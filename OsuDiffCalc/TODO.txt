STYLE:
	- comments should be '// text here' not '//text here'
	- replace command line output with actual logging

BUGS:
	- does not show graphs if it has cached difficulty data
		- need to re-analyze to generate graph
	- sometimes fails to find song if osu already open and playing song
	- after a while failed to analyze maps, UI was responsive but it stopped updating mapset

FEATURES:
	- understand sliders
	- add 'open folder in explorer'
	- add difficulty rating from osu / osu API

OVERHAULS:
  - "friendly scale" feels compressed on the top end (many 2.0* are similar to 3.0, but 8.0 is much harder than 7.0 and many things fall into 4.5-5.5)
	- xml -> actual database schema
	- winforms hacks -> WPF + MVVM

FIX DIFFCALC: 
	sometimes stops (console.log on threads to check if stopped)
		transitioning from charted map -> taiko only -> normal map
	be my friend - brokenarrow (taiko only)

	preparing for te shakedown (search 'slider') - NO AUDIO HOOKS????
		yuh oh - handle.exe also fails for these (very tiny files - caching issue?)
		created a solution for this problem based on window titles and previous history

	Finder.cs
		- fix a max call time with thread.join

"Main.cs"

"win32processes"
	- possible optimizations

[FileProcessor]
	[BeatmapObjects]
		"Slider.cs"
			- calculate slider endpoint properly (endpoint != last point in array, because of time snapping)
			  for curved sliders, this will become expensive very quickly
			- calculate the error margin due to the OD of the map to see whether a player has to move their cursor
	[FileParserHelpers]
		- change all parse() methods to bool for error-catching and verification in "Parser.cs"

	"MapsetManager.cs"
		- parallel execution of buildSet() and analyzeMapset()??

	"Analyzer.cs"
		- pattern difficulty
			- squares
			- line jumps (diff increases drastically with num notes)
			- repeated patterns
		- cs, od, hp difficulty
		- slider difficulty
			- does not understand slider shapes, look at lazer source code if needed
			- does not understand slider end times (related to shape)
			- does not consider 'margin of error' around slider (does OD affect this?)
		- spinners difficulty
			- figure out 'required speed to get 300' (does OD affect this?)
			- make some assumption like 1/2 note to reach spinner, 1/2 to leave
		- proper doubles difficulty

[UserInterface]
	"GUI.cs"
		- change color theme for GUI (black bg)
		- make GUI background translucent

		- separate beatmap analyzer and window updater to their own cs files
			- maybe in a background tasks directory


OVERALL FLOW

- find the path to the current mapset by analyzing hooks                   MapsetManager.getCurrentMapset() -> Finder.getOpenFiles...()
- get mapset
	- check xml for mapset                                                 SavefileXMLManager.doesMapsetExist()
		- if so, check for completeness                                    SavefileXMLManager.getMissingDiffPaths()
			- if not, analyze non-analyzed maps                            MapsetManager.analyzeMap()
				- save mapset to XML                                       SavefileXMLManager.saveMapset()
			- if so, do nothing                         
		- if not, analyze all maps                                         iterate all on analyzeMap()
			- save mapset to XML                                           SavefileXMLManager.saveMapset()
- display mapset information on screen
