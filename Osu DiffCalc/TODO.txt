STYLE:
	- change all methods to start with uppercase, change constants to all uppercase
		done: gui.cs, savefilexmlmanager, finder, [analyzerobjects],
			  [beatmapobjects]
		todo: [filefinder], win32process
			  [fileparserhelpers], analyzer, beatmap, mapset, mapsetmanager,
			  parser


FIX DIFFCALC: 
	low cs increase
	sometimes stops (console.log on threads to check if stopped)
		transitioning from charted map -> taiko only -> normal map
	be my friend - brokenarrow (taiko only)

	preparing for te shakedown (search 'slider') - NO AUDIO HOOKS????
		yuh oh - handle.exe also fails for these (very tiny files - caching issue?)
		created a solution for this problem based on window titles and previous history


	Finder.cs
		- fix a max call time with thread.join

"Main.cs"

"win32processes"
	- possible optimizations

[FileProcessor]
	[BeatmapObjects]
		"Slider.cs"
			- calculate slider endpoint properly (endpoint != last point in array, because of time snapping)
			  for curved sliders, this will become expensive very quickly
			- calculate the error margin due to the OD of the map to see whether a player has to move their cursor
	[FileParserHelpers]
		- change all parse() methods to bool for error-catching and verification in "Parser.cs"

	"MapsetManager.cs"
		- parallel execution of buildSet() and analyzeMapset()??

	"Analyzer.cs"
		- pattern difficulty
			- squares
			- line jumps (diff increases drastically with num notes)
			- repeated patterns
		- cs difficulty
		- slider difficulty
		- proper couplet difficulty

[UserInterface]
	"GUI.cs"
		- change color theme for GUI (black bg)
		- make GUI background translucent

		- separate beatmap analyzer and window updater to their own cs files
			- maybe in a background tasks directory


OVERALL FLOW

- find the path to the current mapset by analyzing hooks                   MapsetManager.getCurrentMapset() -> Finder.getOpenFiles...()
- get mapset
	- check xml for mapset                                                 SavefileXMLManager.doesMapsetExist()
		- if so, check for completeness                                    SavefileXMLManager.getMissingDiffPaths()
			- if not, analyze non-analyzed maps                            MapsetManager.analyzeMap()
				- save mapset to XML                                       SavefileXMLManager.saveMapset()
			- if so, do nothing                         
		- if not, analyze all maps                                         iterate all on analyzeMap()
			- save mapset to XML                                           SavefileXMLManager.saveMapset()
- display mapset information on screen
